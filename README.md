These files will optimize scheduling an additional class section for a range of inputed times.  Final_fxn() is the only function that needs an input, the rest of the functions will run off of this file.  If you need any help with any of the functions, type "help *function_name*" in the command window and MATLAB will tell you what the function does and how to properly pass parameters if necessary.
