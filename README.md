# The "newtestcase" file is the one that reads in the information from excel from the large list of all classes.  The "read_popular_classes" is the function that reads in the 73 most popular classes and creates a new matrix that only includes the sections of those classes. "Class_matrix_generator" finds the times that the classes take place and makes a visual representation of this, also stores the times in a matrix.
